# Carbon-less: Monitor your carbon footprint

[Video Demo!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shWGwagAfl4)

Awareness and mindfulness is necessary to make real change, Carbon-less aims to be a part of that by providing real-time emissions tracking in order to more accurately calculate fuel-efficiency and therefore arrive at a more precise calculations of emissions.

Using react-native, we worked on getting live updates from the phone's GPS services to calculate real-time carbon emissions and other statistics in order to have accurate calculations. The** significant challenges** we overcame involved working with constant streams of geolocations (and the calculations that came along with that) as well as robust app development with asynchronous data. The chief concern in our mind and confirmed by https://fueleconomy.gov/feg/driveHabits.jsp, was that fuel efficiency changes at different speeds, as seen below:
